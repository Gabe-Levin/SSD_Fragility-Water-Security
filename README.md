# Assessment of the Fragility and Water Security in South Sudan
This repo conatinas a spatial assessment of key water-related challenges and opportunities in South Sudan. The spatial assessment is intended to be both descriptive and inferential, where data allows. The assessment builds upon recent spatial analysis for South Sudan carried out as part of the following policy reports: South Sudan Floods 2020 – Remote flood damage and needs assessment; Transforming Agriculture from Humanitarian Aid to a Development Oriented Growth Path in South Sudan; Disasters, conflict and displacement. Intersectional risks in South Sudan. 

# Note
The code seen in this repo is part of a larger, yet unpublished, report. The final maps have been removed and the code has been modified to be non-identifying of project participants, and therefore may seem only partially complete. The full project report will be published shortly, and shared here within the repo.
